## Notes for Crunch developers

This branch of pyreadstat has been forked from the [original repo](https://github.com/Roche/pyreadstat). It introduces
support for reading multiple response sets (MRSets) from SAV files, which we are relying on in crunch-lake.

Until this work can be upstreamed into readstat and pyreadstat proper, we are maintaining this modified version under
a suffix tagging scheme.

The latest version of pyreadstat is currently `1.2.7`. The current version of this fork is `1.2.7.2`.
